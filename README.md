# data_algebra
[Codd style operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) in a [piped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) or [method-chained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) notation (or [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)-esque) data processing in Python

In development, and not ready for use yet.

This is to be the [`Python`](https://www.python.org) equivalent of the [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) packages [`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/) and [`rqdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable).  This package will supply piped Codd-transform style notation that 
can perform data engineering in [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) and generate [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) queries from the same specification.
