Codd piped-style data processing in Python

In development.

This is to be the [`Python`](https://www.python.org) equivilent of the [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) packages [`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/) and [`rqdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable).  This package will supply piped Codd-transform style notation that 
can perform data engineering in [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) and generate [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) queries from the same specification.
