The SQL succinctly included a number of features: replacing missing observations with zero, joining observation keys to action keys, and aggregation.

One also may worry over size of intermediate materialized tables, as a naive translation of the SQL query into relational steps may involve an \"under-keyed join\" which can lead to an explicit large intermediate result prior to filtering and aggregation .\n",

In some sense we are forced to over-specify the solution as we move away from SQL's declarative nature to specifying the exact relational operators in exact order (which is usually the job of a query planner). Or we may benefit by choosing a translation well suited for our data. In either case my proposed data algebra relational solution is as follows."
