    "# Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "This article introduces the [`data_algebra`](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra) project: a data processing tool family available in `R` and `Python`.  These tools are designed to transform data either in-memory or on remote databases.  For an example (with video) of using `data_algebra` to re-arrange data layout please see [here](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra/blob/master/Examples/cdata/ranking_pivot_example.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will discuss the `Python` implementation (also called `data_algebra`) and its relation to the mature `R` implementations (`rquery` and `rqdatatable`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The project intent is to realize a method chained data processing language based on [Codd's relational operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) that is easy to maintain, has helpful tooling, and has very similar realizations (or dialects) for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) databases accessed from [`Python`](https://www.python.org), useful working at scale with `PostgreSQL` or Apache `Spark` (`Spark` example [here](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra/blob/master/Examples/Spark/pyspark_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "  * [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) `DataFrame` objects in `Python`.\n",
    "  * `SQL` databases access from [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) (implementation is [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery), and is mature and ready for production use).\n",
    "  \n",
    "The intent is the notation should look idiomatic in each language.  Working in `Python` should feel like working in `Python`, and working in `R` should feel like working in `R`.  The data semantics, however, are designed to be close to the `SQL` realizations (given the close connection of `SQL` to the relational algebra; in particular row numbering starts at `1` and row and column order is not preserved except at row-order steps or select-columns steps respectively). The intent is: it should be very easy to use the system in either `Python` or `R` (a boon to multi-language data science projects) and it is easy to port either code or experience from one system to another (a boon for porting projects, or for data scientists working with more than one code base or computer language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Related work includes:\n",
    "\n",

    "The `data_algebra` principles include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Writing data transforms as a pipeline or method-chain of many simple transform steps.\n",
    "  * Treating data transform pipelines or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as themselves being sharable data.\n",
    "  * Being able to use the same transform specification many places (in memory, on databases, in `R`, in `Python`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data_algebra` supplies two primary services:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Building composite data processing pipelines (which we demonstrate in this note).\n",
    "  * Building record transforms (which we demonstrate [here](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra/blob/master/Examples/cdata/cdata_general_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a pipeline example in `Python` (for a record transform example, please see [here](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra/blob/master/Examples/cdata/cdata_general_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example we will assume we have a data set of how many points different subjects score in a psychological survey.  The goal is transform the data so that we see what fraction of the subjects answers are in each category (subject to an exponential transform, as often used in [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)).  We then treat the per-subject renormalized data as a probability or diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact meaning of such a scoring method are not the topic of this note.  It is a notional example to show a non-trivial data transformation need.  In particular: having to normalize per-subject (divide some set of scores per-subject by a per-subject total) is a classic pain point in data-processing.  In classic `SQL` this can only be done by joining against a summary table, or in more modern `SQL` with a \"[window function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_window_function).\" We want to show by working in small enough steps this can be done simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our `Python` example.  First we import the packages we are going to use, and set a few options.\n"

A more concise variation of this pipeline can be found in the R example [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery).\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is: the user can build up very sophisticated processing pipelines using a small number of primitive steps.  The pipelines tend to be long, but can still be very efficient- as they are well suited for use with `Pandas` and with `SQL` query optimizers.  Most of the heavy lifting is performed by the  very powerful \"window functions\" (triggered by use of `partition_by` and `order_by`) available on the `extend()` step.  Multiple statements can be combined into extend steps, but only when they have the same window-structure, and don't create and use the same value name in the same statement (except for replacement, which is shown in this example).  Many conditions are checked and enforced during pipeline construction, making debugging very easy.\n",

    "For a more Pythonic way of writing the same pipeline we can show how the code would have been formatted by [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black).\n"
