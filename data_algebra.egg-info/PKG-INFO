Description: 
        [data_algebra](https://github.com/WinVector/data_algebra) is a piped data wrangling system
        based on Codd's relational algebra and experience working with dplyr at scale, and a general 
        data record transform engine.  The primary purpose of the package is to support an easy to 
        compose and maintain grammar of data processing steps that in turn can be used to generate
        database specific SQL. The package also implements the same transforms for Pandas DataFrames 
        and Dask.
        
        [R](https://www.r-project.org) versions of the system are available as 
        the [rquery](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) and 
        [rqdatatable](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable) packages.
        
        Recommended packages include: PyYAML (supplies yaml), sqlparse, black, and dask.
